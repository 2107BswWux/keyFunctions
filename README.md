The project is looking at making the use of
key up and key down functions
-------------------
the way in which we gain access to keys is through the use of key codes
to acces key codes we need to use a window.addEventListener
and the specify what we want to listen to

from there we can activate code through the use of either a key down or key up function

in this instance we are using the key down and key up functions to create a beat pad and change colours of divs randomly
